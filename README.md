# sortVisualization
## What is it?

1. Open https://nikitarizh.github.io/sortVisualization/
2. Click on a button titled with the type of sorting you want to be visualized

#### Advanced use
You can also set length of array, frame time, shapes and enable audio output
1. Set length of array using the first input field (**100** by default)
2. Set frame time using the second input field (1 for quick demo, 10-20 for medium speed, 50-100 is for slow) (**20** by default)
3. Enable audio by pressing the button (high freq is comparing, low freq is swapping) (Optional, **_Chrome only_**)
4. Set shapes by clicking a thumbnail (**circles** by default)
