# sortVisualization
## What is it?
It's a script which shows you how different algorithms sort arrays, so you can understand how these algorithms work
## How to use
1. Open https://nikitarizh.github.io/sortVisualization/
2. Set length of array (using the text input field)
3. Set frame time (1 for quick demo, 10-20 for medium speed, 50-100 is for slow)
4. Enable audio (if you want ofc) (high freq is comparing, low freq is swapping)
5. Click on a button titled with the type of sorting you want to be visualized
6. Enjoy!
